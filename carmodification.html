          <h1>This Baby Bronco RC Car Off-Roads as Well as the Real Thing</h1>
          <p>
            Originally introduced in 1966 as a 4x4 compact SUV, the Ford Bronco
            matured as a full-size truck in the late 1970s, cementing its status
            as a rugged off-roader.

            A shaft-driven four-wheel-drive system gives the Bronco its off-road
            capability. The differential has four gears with remote locking
            capability. There's a two-speed, high-low transmission with remote
            shifting.

          <h2>Remote Locking Differentials</h2>
          <p>
            Traxxas gives you the versatility to lock and unlock the front and
            rear differentials to suit your driving needs directly from your
            transmitter. Leave the differentials unlocked for relaxed driving on
            the trail with smooth, tight turning and better handling at high
            speeds. When the trail gets technical, lock the front and rear
            differentials, or just the front, for superior grip over extreme
            terrain. This patented design has been proven rugged and capable in
            the Traxxas Summit. Sleeved micro cables control the differential
            action for scale appearance, without limiting the huge suspension
            articulation.

        <h2>Hi/Low Range Transmission</h2>
        <p>When the going gets tough, use your transmitter to shift into low range for incredible 4-wheel drive pulling torque. Shift into high range for blasting down the trail. The plush suspension design absorbs rough terrain with ease and delivers outstanding scale appearance. Unmatched versatility makes the TRX-4 Scale and Trail Crawler adaptable to just about any situation or driving style.</p>

      <div class="taxbox-tax1">
        <h2>Waterproof</h2>
        <p>Traxxas was the first to bring you fully waterproof RC vehicles years ago with their innovative designs. The TRX-4 Scale and Trail Crawler is fully waterproof for how you like to really play, not “splash resistant.” There is a big difference. Traxxas' patented innovation gives you the freedom to tackle creeks, snow, and mud without worrying about water in your electronics.

      <div class="taxbox-tax2">
        <h2>Torque Twist Eliminated</h2>
        <p>The portal axles use gear reduction right at the wheels that dramatically reduces undesirable torque twist. Total axle gear reduction is over twice non-portal designs. The Titan 550 motor torque is translated into straight, powerful, forward motion, rather than wasted energy twisting your rig right off the rocks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="taxbox-tax2"><h2>The Power of Portals</h2>
      <p>The TRX-4 Scale and Trail Crawler is equipped right out of the box with Traxxas' game-changing portal axle set. Portal axles lift the truck at the wheels for huge center pumpkin ground clearance. In order to achieve the same clearance with straight axles (and not get stuck), your tires would have to be over an inch taller than the TRX-4's tires.</p></div>
